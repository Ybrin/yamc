- remove block outline textures by adding dedicated shader
- make the selection always select the correct block 
	- by factoring in the direction in which the player is looking (can show from which side the block is looked at)
- find actual chunk of selection
- understand my own coordinate system better and possibly prevent inaccuracy errors for high x,y or z values
