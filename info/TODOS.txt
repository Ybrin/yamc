+ remove block outline textures by adding dedicated shader
+ make the selection always select the correct block 
	- by factoring in the direction in which the player is looking (can show from which side the block is looked at)
- change the world[][] array into a chunk cache + savegame/worldgen
	- the active chunks will come from the rendering range via the meshindices only
- make the rendering range follow the player (player always in the center chunk)
- find actual chunk of selection
- understand my own coordinate system better and possibly prevent inaccuracy errors for high x,y or z values


Ideas:
- add yamnation
- add custom limboroll story map
